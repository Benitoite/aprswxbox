aprswxbox
=========

An Arduino project that collects basic weather parameters and sends to APRS network.

##NOTE: Be sure to GET REQUIRED LIBRARIES listed below!
###ONLY DHT library downloaded from links below will work, the original DHT library will NOT work!

##libraries

The DHT library is from AdaFruit [https://github.com/yangl1996/DHT-sensor-library](https://github.com/yangl1996/DHT-sensor-library).

The BMP085 library is also from AdaFruit [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library)

##Instructions

To build an APRSWXBox, check the graph and other info provided.

A complete set of hardware includes an Arduino, a W5100 shield, a DHT21 sensor and a BMP085 sensor.

You will need a 5-digit passcode to sign in the APRS-IS network which is intended only for amateur radio operators.
